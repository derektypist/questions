# Questions

The purpose is to provide the Questions Project using plain JavaScript without using any frameworks.  However, Font Awesome and Google Fonts will be used.

## UX

As a user, I want to hide or show the answer to any question.

As a user, when I go on to the page for the first time, I expect the plus icon to be displayed.

Information Architecture - Questions and Answers are Strings.

This is about Lockdown (as applied to a crisis such as Coronavirus).  Questions include Definition, What I Must Do and Going on Holiday.

## Features

Ability to show and hide answers to questions.  When the plus icon is clicked, the answer appears.  When the minus icon is clicked, the answer disappears.

## Technologies

Uses the technologies of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Google Fonts (Barlow and Roboto) and Font Awesome 5.15.3.

## Testing

Ensure that user stories have been met.

## Deployment

Deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://derektypist.github.io/questions) at the main branch.
